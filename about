                        <p> Since 2022, I've had the honor of being the captain of Drury University's tennis team. This experience has been transformative, teaching me valuable lessons in teamwork, resilience, and unwavering support during challenging moments. Through tennis, I have formed lifelong friendships with incredible people who have become like family to me. I am deeply grateful for the opportunities tennis has provided, and I carry with me a great passion for the sport that I know will endure for the rest of my life.

            <h1>SCHOOL</h1>
                
            <p>In the fall of 2021, I enrolled as a student at Drury University. For the first year, my documents had a conspicuous label: "UNDECIDED" in the place reserved for my major. Uncertain about which academic path to choose, I explored various interests. I was always eager to try new things, and I believed it would be the best way to discover what interested me. It wasn't until I attended a cyber security meeting that everything fell into place. Meeting Professor Shannon McMurtry left a lasting impression; his warmth and expertise helped me make my decision. To help myself grow in my field, I joined the Cyber Defense Club. It was one of the best decisions I could ever make. This club helped me learn so much and feel more comfortable with cyber security problems.</p>

            <p>To summarize my university experience, my overall GPA is 3.74, with my major GPA being 3.88 GPA. With time, I've come to realize that cyber security courses resonate with me the most. The challenges and complexities of the field captivate my interest like nothing else, fueling my determination to excel in this domain.</p>
             <h1>Cyber Defense Club</h1>
             <p>During our weekly meetings, we're gearing up for cyber security competitions, including the prestigious National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition.

Our training covers a wide array of tools and platforms, like VMware, Splunk, NMAP, Wireshark, and many others. Additionally, every year, all members participate in the National Cyber League, further honing our skills and camaraderie in the field of cyber security.</p>
             <h1>Experience</h1>
             <p> In 2023, I began my role as a cybersecurity technician at Drury University. I was initially tasked with reviewing and crafting cybersecurity policies and plans, but my responsibilities quickly expanded. Within months, I took on additional duties from the networking department, including preparing switches for installation, maintaining detailed records of switch inventory, and managing devices in the university's networking closets. This dynamic role allows me to contribute to both cybersecurity initiatives and network infrastructure, ensuring a good and secure digital environment for the university community.</p>
